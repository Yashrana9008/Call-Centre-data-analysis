🚀 Call Center Performance Dashboard 🚀

I'm excited to share this **Power BI Dashboard** that I created to analyze **Call Center Data**! 📊

🔍 **Key Insights:**
- **Total Calls:** 5000+
- **Calls Answered:** 4054
- **Calls Abandoned:** 946
- **Customer Satisfaction Rating:** 3.33/5

This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of call center operations, helping to track key metrics such as:
1. **Agent Performance**: Compare calls answered vs. abandoned for each agent and identify top performers.
2. **Topic Analysis**: Visualize how different call topics (e.g., Technical Support, Payment-related) impact performance.
3. **Satisfaction Trends**: Track customer satisfaction over time and identify potential areas for improvement.
4. **Call Resolutions**: Understand the relationship between call duration and issue resolution rates.

💡 **Features:**
- Interactive filters for agents, topics, and time periods for deeper analysis.
- A combination of bar charts, line graphs, and tables to offer multiple perspectives.
- Data visualization to highlight **peak performance periods** and **agent efficiency**.

Power BI has been an invaluable tool for making data-driven decisions and identifying opportunities for optimization. I'm always looking to refine and improve my skills in data analytics.
